🚦 Adaptive Traffic Management System
📌 Overview
The Adaptive Traffic Management System is an AI-powered solution designed to optimize traffic flow dynamically using real-time data. By integrating computer vision and machine learning, the system intelligently adjusts traffic signals to minimize congestion and improve road efficiency.

🎯 Key Features
🚗 Real-time Traffic Monitoring: Uses YOLO object detection to analyze vehicle density at intersections.

🕒 Smart Signal Timing: Dynamically adjusts signal durations based on live traffic data.

📡 IoT & Cloud Integration: Enables remote monitoring and data analytics.

📉 Traffic Prediction: Uses machine learning algorithms to predict peak congestion times.

⚡ Efficient & Scalable: Works in both urban and suburban areas for better traffic flow management.

🏗️ Technologies Used
Python (OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas)

YOLO (You Only Look Once) for vehicle detection

Flask / FastAPI for backend services

GitHub & Git LFS for version control
